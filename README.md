# reynolds-sbit
The SBIT site under Reynolds Community College.


Extra content shown in the original view could instead be condensed into slides in the carousel on the updated version (events,faculty member of the month, etc).

Users won’t have to scroll as far and can easily access each available program under SBIT.

Programs are grouped by color into similar areas of study.

The original site has the navigation
underneath all of the content and may be
skipped by someone that is looking for
something specific quickly and not trying
to scroll through the entire homepage. In
the updated version the navigation lives on
the left side of the page and stays in view
no matter where the user scrolls. Content
is still fully inview and the menu can easily
be accessed by tapping the arrow.

The main reynolds navigation links are now both listed within the hamburger that opens when tapped. The main navigation is listed at the top with dropdowns for each category indicated by a “+”, same with the
secondary navigation that displays underneath. Links without a “+” will
navigate to the new page and those with the “+” will open their respective
dropdowns. Navigation isintended to be easier to use for those on mobile/tablet as the original links don’t appear to open dropdowns when tapping them and they’re somewhat small and grouped closely together (easy to hit the wrong link by accident when on a phone).
