            <h2>Accounting</h2>

            <p>Growing businesses, changing financial regulations and increased scrutiny of company finances have led to a growing demand for accountants. From learning the basics of accounting to becoming a CPA, Reynolds has a program that fits your needs. Accounting students work with real-world problems to develop the problem-solving and technical skills required to work in the public and private sectors.</p>
            <p>Professors with real-life experience teach you the fundamentals of accounting, financial statement analysis, management/cost accounting, taxation, auditing, fraud examination and computerized accounting. Dedicated instruction is a cornerstone of the program; your accounting classes will offer small face-to-face classes and video lectures for online classes.</p>
